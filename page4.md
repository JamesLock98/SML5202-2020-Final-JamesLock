<h1>Verbs & Vocabulary</h1>
<p>Verbs are a part of speech used to describe motion or convey a subject in action. Verbs are of great importance in language learning - without verbs, sentences cannot exist. </p>
<p> Verbs have an infinitive form - the basic dictionary form. Verbs must be conjugated to match with the subject sentence and create a pattern that can be understood more specifically. </p>
<p> Vocabulary is a collection of words and/or phrases known to a person in a language. The more advanced the vocabulary, the more able a person is to communicate through writing, speech, reading and listening. </p>

<p> Here are some examples of some basic commonly used verbs in Russian, as well as how they are conjugated to fit past, present and future verb aspects. </p>
