<p>If you are looking to expand your knowledge beyond this elementary/beginner site then we have a few sites in mind! </p>
<br>
<p> We have here some external resources and links that we believe are vital to learning the fundamentals of Russian.</p>
<br>
<p> These are some of the best sites widely used other language learners such as yourselves.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to these, we also have some links for a Russian Dictionary and The Foreign Travel Advice page from the UK government website, that is essential if you are planning a trip to Russia. <i>(Please check your own government website for planned trips to the Russian Federation)</i> </p>
